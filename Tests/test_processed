A couple **yea**rs ago, I got a **job** interview at a **big**-name **uni**versity and I had to **dec**ide whether to go **und**ercover or not. On **pap**er, I **loo**ked like a **nor**mal candidate. But on the **int**ernet, I was **say**ing all sorts of **wac**ko things, like how [it’s **coo**l to **dit**ch **sci**entific **jou**rnals](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-peer-review?utm_source=publication-search) and just [**pub**lish your **pap**ers as **blo**g posts **ins**tead](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/things-could-be-better).

If the **uni**versity wanted to **hir**e me, I was **pret**ty sure they wanted the *normal* me, not the **wac**ko me. But I was also **sta**rting to **sus**pect the **wac**ko me was the *real* me. This was a **big** **pro**blem, because that **job** came with a **pay**check, an **off**ice, and the **app**roval of my **pea**rs. Could I maybe **Tro**jan **Hor**se myself into their **dep**artment and only **rev**eal my true **nat**ure after we’d **sig**ned all the **doc**uments (“Ha ha, you **foo**ls! Couldn’t you tell I’ve gone **ban**anas??”)? Or could I maybe **loc**k up my **wac**kiness, maybe **for**ever, or at least until I had **ten**ure, when I could let it **loo**se again?

Those **lie**s were extremely **tem**pting, but they were also **lie**s. I knew that if I went **und**ercover, at some **poi**nt they were going to show me a **pic**ture of my **wac**ko self and ask, “Do you know this **man**?” and I would have to say, “**Nev**er heard of him.” As much as I **lov**e having **hea**lth **ins**urance, I couldn’t **bri**ng myself to do that.

So in the end I went as the **real** me, a **nor**mal guy who was in the **pro**cess of **bec**oming a **wac**ko, like a **cat**erpillar who had **snug**gled up **ins**ide his **coc**oon and was soon to **eme**rge as a, I **dun**no, a **tee**ny tiny **wal**rus in a **fed**ora. I gave my **nor**mal **tal**k about my **dis**sertation—a **pro**ject I **lov**ed and was **hap**py to **pre**sent—but I ended by **say**ing, “I don’t think we need a **hun**dred more **pap**ers like this one. We need to turn **psy**chology into a **par**adigmatic **sci**ence, and I think I can help do that.” I told them why I thought **psy**chology hadn’t made much **pro**gress in the past few **dec**ades, and how it could, and how I might be **wro**ng about **eve**rything, but I would **hop**efully be **wro**ng in a **use**ful way. When **peo**ple asked me if I **pla**nned to **pub**lish my **pap**ers in **jou**rnals, I said no, and I **exp**lained why.

It probably doesn’t sound like **muc**h, but this was the **sca**riest thing I’ve ever done. This is the **aca**demic **equ**ivalent of **get**ting on **sta**ge and **moo**ning the **aud**ience. You’re not supposed to say this **stu**ff, **esp**ecially not at a **job** interview. You’re **ris**king a **fat**e **wor**se than **dea**th—people might think you’re *weird*.

That’s how it felt when I *decided* to do all that, anyway. But on the actual day, I didn’t feel **afr**aid at all. I felt **fre**e. **Inv**incible, even. I had already **con**demned myself to **dea**th, so what could they do to me now? In the **unl**ikely event that they **lik**ed the **real** me, great! And if they didn’t, well, **bet**ter to find that out **soo**ner **rat**her than later. The only **rea**l **dan**ger was if they **hir**ed the **fak**e me and then I had to **pre**tend to be the **fak**e me for the **res**t of my life.

I **exp**ected to last like 15 **min**utes before someone said, “Oh wow we’ve made a **ter**rible **mis**take, please **lea**ve.” **Ins**tead, people were **nic**e. Some of them were **exc**ited—if nothing else, they had never seen someone get on **sta**ge and **dro**p their **dra**wers before. A couple people were like “**Bet**ween you and me, *I* like what you’re **doi**ng, but I don’t know about the **oth**ers.” I never **enc**ountered those **sup**posed **oth**ers, but maybe they **wai**ted until I left their **off**ice to **bus**t out **lau**ghing. Some were **ske**ptical, but in a “I’m **tak**ing you **ser**iously” kind of way. And some people didn’t **rea**ct at all, as if I was being so **wei**rd that they couldn’t even **per**ceive it, like I was up there **sla**pping my bare **butt**cheeks and they were like, “Um yeah I had a **que**stion about slide four?”

And then...I got the **job**!!

Haha no just **kid**ding I didn’t get the **job**, are you **nut**s?

But **for**tunately it didn’t **hur**t at all, it **act**ually felt **gre**at!

Haha no it **suc**ked! Of **cou**rse it **hur**ts when people **han**g out with you all day and then **dec**ide they don’t ever want to **han**g out with you again. I might be a **wac**ko, but I’m not a **psy**chopath.

And yet the **hur**t was only **ski**n deep. It felt like I got a **pap**er cut when I **exp**ected to be **saw**n in half. I guess I **ima**gined that being myself would make me feel **sai**ntly but **gri**m, like one of those **mar**tyrs in a **Ren**aissance **pai**nting who has a halo around his head and a sword through his **bel**ly. **Kin**da like this:
